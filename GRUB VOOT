CNVI MODE (DISABLE)  | Related to WIFI and Bluetooth

WWAN Reset Workaround (DISABLE) | Related to WIFI

WIFI SAR (DISABLE) | Related to WIFI

WWAN Device (DISABLE)  | Related to WIFI

C6DRAM (DISABLE) | Related to CStates, Allows moving DRAM contents to PRM memory when CPU is in C6 state. 

Software Guards Extensions (DISABLE)  | Related to Security

AP Threads Idle Manner | Set to “RUN Loop” (99% sure this is not on AMD systems) I had better smoothness/mouse feel setting it to RUN Loop.

MonitorMWait (DISABLE) | Completely useless

Intel Trusted Execution Technology (DISABLE) | Related to TPM and Security

Intel RMT State (DISABLE) | Puts PC in a sleep low-power mode

Intel Ready Mode Technology (DISABLE) | Puts pc in a sleep low-power mode

Limit CPUID Maximum (ENABLE) | Will allow legacy OS to boot even without support for CPUs with extended CPUID functions.

Intel(R) Speed Shift Technology Interrupt Control (DISABLE) | Related to Speed shift.

Boot performance mode | Set to “Turbo Performance”

EIST (DISABLE) | Enhanced Intel Speedstep, throttling.

Interrupt Redirection Mode Selection | Set to “Round Robin” This immensely helps smoothness and input. (Make sure its not “PAIR with Round robin”)

Intel Adaptive Thermal Monitor (DISABLE) | Useless.

Energy Performance Gain (DISABLE) | Helps with ram latency.

Energy Efficient P-state (DISABLE) | Related to Power-saving.

Energy Efficient Turbo (DISABLE) | Related to Power-saving.

PS2 Keyboard and Mouse (DISABLE) | Disable this if you do not use a PS2 peripheral.

CrashLog Feature (DISABLE) | Related to logging.

Enable Hibernation (DISABLE) | Related to sleeping/hibernation.

ACPI Standby State | Set to “Suspend Disable”.

PCI-X Latency Timer | Set to 32 PCI Bus Clocks “0x20”.

BME DMA Mitigation (DISABLE) | Related to security.

Type C Support (DISABLE) | Related to Type-c.

Enable RH Prevention (DISABLE) | Related to Security.

Per Bank Refresh (DISABLE) | Related to DIMM Refreshing.

Channel A DIMM Control | This is for DIMM A Control, “Disable DIMM0” disables DIMM 1, and “Disable DIMM1” disables DIMM2.




Channel B DIMM Control | This is for DIMM B Control, “Disable DIMM0” disables DIMM 1, and “Disable DIMM1” disables DIMM2.

Power Down Unused Lanes (DISABLE) | Related to Power down for PCIe lanes. (There are tons of these, so make sure to go through, get the offset and disable it in Grub)

LTR (DISABLE) | Latency Tolerance Reporting, related to power saving in a way. (There are tons of them, so you need to find the offsets, and disable them in Grub.)

DDR PowerDown and idle counter (DISABLE/SET TO PCODE) | This is RAM Powerdown. Can shave off a few ns on RAM.

SelfRefresh Enable (DISABLE) | Related to RAM Refreshing, helps with input a decent bit. Can cause issues with booting/restarting - on low end boards. (use power button on pc to reboot.)

LAN Wake From DeepSx (DISABLE) | Useless.

Wake on LAN Enable (DISABLE) | Useless.

Disable DSX ACPRESENT PullDown (ENABLE) | Useless.

Legacy IO Low Latency (ENABLE) | Test enabled.

PCH Cross Throttling (DISABLE) | Related to throttling.

PCH Energy Reporting (DISABLE) Related to logging.

PCI Express Clock Gating (DISABLE) | Related to power-saving.

Disable Gen2 Pll Shutdown and L1 Controller Power gating (ENABLE) | Related to power-saving. (This setting is on each PCIe lane, so make sure to go through and disable.)

Snoop Latency Multiplier (Set to 0x0) | Still TESTING, this won’t mess up anything, test and see if you feel a difference or gain higher framerates. (There are multiple Latency Multipliers, so make sure to go through and set to 0x0.)

Snoop Latency Value (Set to 0x0) | Still TESTING, this won’t mess up anything, test and see if you feel a difference or gain higher framerates. (There are multiple Latency Multipliers, so make sure to go through and set to 0x0.)

Non Snoop Latency Multiplier (Set to 0x0) | Still TESTING, this won’t mess up anything, test and see if you feel a difference or gain higher framerates. (There are multiple Latency Multipliers, so make sure to go through and set to 0x0.)

Non Snoop Latency Value (Set to 0x0) | Still TESTING, this won’t mess up anything, test and see if you feel a difference or gain higher framerates. (There are multiple Latency Multipliers, so make sure to go through and set to 0x0.)

PowerDown Energy Ch1Dimm1 (Set to 0x0) | Related to RAM Power Down Mode.

PowerDown Energy Ch1Dimm0 (Set to 0x0) | Related to RAM Power Down Mode.

PowerDown Energy Ch0Dimm1 (Set to 0x0) | Related to RAM Power Down Mode.

PowerDown Energy Ch0Dimm0 (Set to 0x0) | Related to RAM Power Down Mode.

TPM State (DISABLE) | Related to Security

Command Rate Support (Set to 0x0) | Disable this before ram overclocking, as it can force fake command rate and give you bad results.
